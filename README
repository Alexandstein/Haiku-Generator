Python Haiku Generator
======================
This is just a simple program that I made as part of a small cookbook-style Python tutorial

You can run it standalone with just $- python haiku.py since it has its own main section,
or you can import it into your own scripts for use. 

For the purposes of the assignment, it isn't very sophisticated and can't output
grammatically sound sentences. In the future it may end up being worked on to provide
functionality like this.

-------------
Usage
-------------
Using the class is very simple. Just instantiate it by giving the constructor a dictionary
'HaikuGenerator(<pathname>)' and then use '.generate()' to return a string. Information
on any other functions is inside of the docstring.

-------------
Dictionary
-------------
At this iteration, the dictionary files are very simple. Looking into the sample
dictionary included with the program, the files are just .cvs lists with words paired
alongside their syllable count.
Potential future iterations with capacity for grammar will be more sophisticated and
include informations pertaining to how the word is grammatically used.
